# A tribute page to Coluche
## A challenge part of the learning process @ [*FreeCodeCamp*](https://www.freecodecamp.com)

This is a really simple page, made with Bootstrap and jQuery (only 3 scripts: a zoom-in function, a scrollspy function, and a carrousel). <br/>
The design is really basic but is responsive and follows the exercise rules :

- Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

- Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.

  - User Story: I can view a tribute page with an image and text.

  - User Story: I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.
